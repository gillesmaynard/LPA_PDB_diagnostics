# LPA_PDB_diagnostics
LPA PDB diagnostics is a tool that allows data analysis for PIC simulations for laser plasma based accelerators. 
Notebooks are provided to make analysis faster and give a sense of big picture.

## Installation
Installation is simple. Clone this repo to your local computer by using the command ```git clone``` + repo name , then install it by typing on your command line: ```python setup.py install```

## Usage
First, copy the two notebooks to your simulation directory (same level as the /data) or if you prefer just change the variable "dir path" in the notebook and point it to where your pdb data are stored. 

Check if you have ipython by typing ```ipython``` on your command line. If no error appears, congratulations you have it; otherwise you can use ```conda``` or other ways to install ipython, the link is here: https://ipython.org/install.html.

To activate ipython notebook. Go to the directory where your ipynb file is stored, then type ```ipython notebook```, a web page browser will pop up and you can then navigate to the my_filename.ipynb notebook.

The notebooks contain some fundamental analysis that allow you to do an extensive field and particle analysis. More on how to use this code, please check up on https://kcirtap2014.github.io/LPA_PDB_diagnostics/.
