# LPA_PDB_diagnostics
LPA PDB diagnostics is a tool that allows data analysis for PIC simulations for laser plasma based accelerators. 
Notebooks are provided to make analysis faster and give a sense of big picture.

## Installation
Installation is simple. You just have to type on your command line: ```python setup.py install```

## Usage
First, copy the two notebooks to your simulation directory (same level as the /data) or if you prefer just change the variable "dir path" in the notebook and point it to where your pdb data are stored. 

The notebooks contain some fundamental analysis that allow you to do an extensive field and particle analysis. More on how to use this code, please check up on https://kcirtap2014.github.io/LPA_PDB_diagnostics/.
