  "body": "### Welcome to LPA PDB diagnostics.\r\nThis website allows analysis of LPA simulations using PIC code. The supported input format is pdb (using cPickle in Python). This tool allows both fields and particles analysis. It ranges from simple instant per instant analysis to analysis of multiple instances. The greatest feature is the post-processing particle analysis.\r\n\r\n### Installation requirements.\r\nThe following is a list of python modules that is necessary for the installation of LPA PDB diagnostics.\r\n - cPickle\r\n - h5py\r\n - numpy\r\n - scipy\r\n - Ipython notebook (optional)\r\n - pandas (optional)\r\n\r\nThe installation is simple:\r\nType    python setup.py install    in your command line\r\n\r\n### Quickstarts\r\nTwo ipython notebooks are included: \r\n- quickstart_one.ipynb: for an instant per instant analysis\r\n- quickstart_multiple.ipynb: for multiple instances anlysis \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPatrick Lee (@kcirtap2014)\r\n\r\n",
